## Work

Over the years I've worked across the Microsoft stack, on both back and front end solutions, starting with VBA and quickly moving on to the .NET family.

Stumbling upon the Software Craftsmenship and XP movements really changed the way I thought about coding as a profession. In recent years I've been focussed on Cloud Solutions, and have enjoyed really enjoyed the new challenges that comes with the shift in role.

## Rest

More please.

## Play

I am a father to two young girls who run me ragged and both have me wrapped around their fingers. I love the outdoors and spend as much time out in the woods running as time allows. Also enjoy football, cricket, golf, surfing, hiking.
